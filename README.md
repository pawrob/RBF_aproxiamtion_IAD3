# RBF based aproximation

## Introduction
The aim of the task was to implement a radial neural network based on the approximation of the input data set. We implemented the project using approximation and separate learning of two layers.

## Technologies
* Python 3.6
* Radial basis fucntions
## Libraries
* math
* matplotlib
* pandas

## Usage
To run project just start main.py script

```
$ python src/main.py
```
## Demo

Aproximation with declared variables and 10 neurons, 100 iterations and second data set.<br/><br/>
